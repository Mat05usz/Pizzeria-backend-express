# Pizzeria-backend-express

## About
Backend for a Pizzeria website written using express framework and typescript with MongoDB as a database solution. API allows for uploading/downloading 
of menu products (to display on frontend) with images, which are stored on the server with a link in the database.

## Work in progress
I'm working on adding JWT authentication (work is I'd say 75% done).

## Running the server
To run simply navigate to the main project folder and type `npm start`.
